Swapping a line with the line directly above or below it is a common task when writing computer software.
This script provides some mappings for normal, insert and visual modes which make this more easily accomplished.
Using it allows you to move a line (or multiple lines) of text up or down within a document using the <S> and <Up>/<Down> arrow keys.
This is similar to the <Alt> and <Up>/<Down> arrow text movement feature in Eclipse.
